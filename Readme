This is what the script needs to do:

a) 3 tabs or distinct areas
b) 1 for irrigation. 3 valves each with an on duration and an off duration. Each valve is 2 relays. one for the valve and one 
    for the pump.
c) 1 for lighting with an on time and duration - or alternatively a way to pull sunset/daylength times from the internet and then
    add time to it for desired daylength. 
d) 1 for climate. 3 or 4 on/duration timers that control the same two relays.
