For GUI: #updated 3/27
3 total sections needed
  - Watering/valves tab
      - 3 different valves
      - run time and delay time for each valve
      - an on/off time for the whole watering system to run (ie doesnt water at night)
      - easily modifiable. Times should be augmentable in real time
      - need to be able to save the data, and read the times whenever the program is booted. 
      
   - Light controller
      - on/off time
      - potentially just add time to the daylength gathered from the internet
      - on/off button
      
   - climate control
      - turn on a switch for a given period of time, 3 times per day
      -much like the valve tab, but for one switch instead of 3
      - IE on at 10pm, run for 5 min, on at 12am run for 7 min, on at 4am run for 3 min.
